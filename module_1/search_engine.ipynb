    "Embeddings are a way to turn words, sentences, or even whole documents into numbers — specifically, into dense numerical vectors (basically arrays of numbers). Here's why that matters:\n",

    "They capture meaning: Words or phrases with similar meanings end up with similar vectors, even if they’re not exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "They simplify complexity: Embeddings reduce the complexity of text by turning it into a more compact, structured form.\n",
    "\n",
    "They enable machine learning: These numerical vectors can be used in models for things like recommendations, sentiment analysis, and finding patterns in text."
